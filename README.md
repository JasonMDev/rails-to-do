## Introduction
Multiple lists of todo items can be generated.
Each todo list contains its own todo items.
These can be marked as completed or deleted.

This is based on the blog site that [*Mackenzie Child: How To Build A Todo App In Rails 4*](https://mackenziechild.me/) has build.
However it has been built using Rails 5.
